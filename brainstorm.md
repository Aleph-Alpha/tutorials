- from zero to beginner

    - have access to a working PhariaAI deployment

        - have the server side PhariaAI setup (which is done by infra guys, NOT the developer) - this is done one time only per company
            - the server setup is something we'll assume the infra guys done it already; we're not going to address this in our tutorials, but assume it's done already;

        -->>>> for each developer, he/she needs to setup the local environment to consume the PhariaAI service on the local machine
            - this local env setup is going something we're going to address in each of the tutorials we wrote;
