    "# 6. Application deployment - Moving to production\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes the final stage of your RAG application journey: deployment to production. After building, testing, and evaluating your application, this step makes your solution available to end users through the PhariaOS environment and PhariaAssistant interface.\n",

    "## Deployment components\n",
    "\n",
    "The production deployment process involves several interconnected components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PhariaAI CLI**: A command-line interface that streamlines the deployment workflow\n",
    "- **PhariaAssistant integration**: The user-facing interface that provides access to your application\n",
    "- **Container registry**: Secure storage for your application container images\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to prepare your application and environment for production deployment\n",
    "2. How to configure necessary credentials and environment variables\n",
    "3. How to use the PhariaAI CLI to build, publish, and deploy your application\n",
    "4. How to verify successful deployment in Studio, manage user access to the application and test with Assistant\n",
    "5. How to manage your application's lifecycle including updates and removal\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting the deployment process, ensure you have:\n",
