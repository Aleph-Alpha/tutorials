    "## What you will build\n",
    "\n",
    "You will build a fully functional RAG application that:\n",
    "- Processes and indexes your documents\n",
    "- Retrieves relevant information based on queries\n",
    "- Generates accurate AI responses grounded in your data\n",
    "- Can be evaluated and optimised for performance\n",
