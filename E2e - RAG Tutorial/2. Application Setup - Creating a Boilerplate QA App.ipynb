    "# 2. Application setup - Creating a boilerplate Q&A app\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you create a functional question-and-answer application using the PhariaAI Custom Applications quick-start guide. Your interactive Q&A tool will respond to natural language queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q&A app you build acts as the user-facing layer of your RAG system, connecting the document index with large language models to provide contextually relevant answers based on your specific document collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application components\n",
    "\n",
    "The PhariaAI Q&A app architecture consists of several interconnected elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PhariaAI CLI**: Command-line interface for scaffolding, creating, and managing applications\n",
    "- **Configuration files**: Define how your app accesses document collections and language models\n",
    "- **User interface**: Provides a web-based interface for users to submit questions and receive answers\n",
    "- **Service layer**: Handles request processing and orchestrates the retrieval and generation workflow\n",
    "- **Skill component**: Implements the core RAG logic that retrieves documents and generates answers\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you will do next\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up a new Q&A app using the PhariaAI CLI with the specialised `qa` template\n",
    "2. Configure the app components to access your document collection\n",
    "3. Customise the app settings for optimal retrieval and response performance\n",
    "4. Deploy your app for local testing and production environments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure your PhariaAI installation satisfies the following prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PhariaAI version**: You are running PhariaAI version 0.52.4 or higher\n",
    "- **Custom Skills support**: Enabled in your PhariaAI instance with default PhariaKernel namespace names; and you have the credentials for the OCI registry\n",
    "- **Custom applications support**: Enabled in your PhariaAI instance and you have the credentials for the OCI registry\n",
    "- **Platform components**: You have enabled PhariaAssistant, PhariaOS Manager, PhariaKernel, and PhariaStudio, and you have the URLs to access them\n",
    "\n",
    "As a PhariaAI developer, you also need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API token**: A valid Aleph Alpha API token with appropriate permissions\n",
    "- **Component URLS**: You have the URLs to access PhariaAssistant, PhariaKernel, and PhariaStudio\n",
    "- **Permissions**: The *StudioUser* permission, as described in [User Setup](1.%20Introduction%20-%20Getting%20Started.ipynb#user-setup)"
