    "# 2. Application Setup - Creating a Boilerplate QA App\n",
    "\n",
    "This section guides you through creating a functional question-answering application using the PhariaAI applications quick start guide. You'll leverage the document collection you set up in the previous section and transform it into an interactive Q&A tool that can respond to natural language queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q&A application we'll build acts as the user-facing layer of your RAG system, connecting the document index with large language models to provide contextually relevant answers based on your specific document collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Components\n",
    "\n",
    "The PhariaAI Q&A application architecture consists of several interconnected elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pharia CLI**: Command-line interface for scaffolding, creating, and managing applications\n",
    "- **Configuration Files**: Define how your application accesses document collections and language models\n",
    "- **User Interface**: Provides a web-based interface for users to submit questions and receive answers\n",
    "- **Service Layer**: Handles request processing and orchestrates the retrieval and generation workflow\n",
    "- **Skill Component**: Implements the core RAG logic that retrieves documents and generates answers\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up a new Q&A application using the Pharia CLI with the specialized qa template\n",
    "2. Configure the application components to access your document collection\n",
    "3. Customize the application settings for optimal retrieval and response performance\n",
    "4. Deploy your application for local testing and production environments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure you have the following in your Pharia Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PhariaAI Version**: You are running PhariaAI version 0.52.4 or higher\n",
    "- **Custom Skills Support**: Enabled in your PhariaAI instance with a default kernel namespace named app created and you have the credentials for the OCI registry\n",
    "- **Custom Applications Support**: Enabled in your PhariaAI instance and you have the credentials for the OCI registry\n",
    "- **Platform Components**: You have enabled PhariaAssistant, PhariaOS Manager, PhariaKernel, and PhariaStudio and you have the URLs to access them\n",
    "\n",
    "As a User make sure to have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API Token**: A valid Aleph Alpha API token with appropriate permissions\n",
