    "Understands the **meaning** behind your queries using advanced language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Searching for \"employee onboarding process\" will find documents about:\n",
    "- New hire procedures\n",
    "- Staff orientation guides  \n",
    "- Training protocols\n",
    "- Welcome documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if they don't contain the exact phrase \"employee onboarding\"!\n",

    "Provides precise, exact-match results when you know specific terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Searching for \"contract-2024-Q3\" will find:\n",
    "- Documents containing exactly that identifier\n",
    "- Perfect for finding specific references, codes, or technical terms\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÄ Hybrid Search\n",
    "Combines the best of both worlds - semantic understanding with keyword precision.\n",
    "\n",
